This group is for anyone interested in machine learning and its applications. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, please join to meet the machine learning community in Bath and the surrounding area.

We aim to hold at least one event per month, featuring talks, workshops and collaborative projects.

Feel free to join the discussion on the BathML Slack group (https://bathml.herokuapp.com/)!
